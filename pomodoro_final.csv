7,2025-08-10 20:47:00,"Learned about the definition of machine learning, machine learning applications and supervised learning. Supervised learning can be further divided into 2 categories, regression and classification. Regression means that the machine learning is trying to predict a number from an infinite possible numbers, while for classification, the machine learning is trying to predict from a finite number of categories or labels. Currently, the machine learning world is dominated by supervised learning.",DeepLearningAI Machine Learning,1,Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification,Coursera,5,1,"""Welcome to machine learning!"", ""Applications of machine learning"", ""What is machine learning?"", ""Supervised learning part 1"", ""Supervised learning part 2"""
8,2025-08-11 13:56:00,"Learned about SELECT, COUNT, DISTINCT and LIMIT statements and WHERE clause. SELECT is a DML (Data manipulation language) that serves to read the data from the database.
           COUNT is an aggregation method to get the total count of the query. DISTINCT is a query to remove all the duplicate values. LIMIT is a query to limit the result to a certain number.
           WHERE clause is used when we want to query the data under certain conditions. We can combine multiple of these statements into one query, for example 
           SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ReleaseYear) FROM FilmLocations WHERE ProductionCompany = 'Warner Bros. Pictures'; to get the total count of unique release years under the condition that the ProductionCompany is Warner Bros. Pictures

10,2025-08-11 15:08:00,"Tested my knowledge of DML statements in the practice and graded quiz. Learned about relational database concepts, concepts about primary and foreign keys, where primary keys of a table must be unique to identify each row. Foreign keys are used to connect one table to another table.
           Learned about DDL statements, ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE. ALTER statement can add or remove columns, modify the data type of columns, add or remove keys and add or remove constraints. DROP will delete the table in the database. TRUNCATE will delete all records of rows in the table, but not the table.

11,2025-08-11 17:00:00,"Learned about supervised learning. There are 3 types of unsupervised learning that will be covered in this specialization, clustering, anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction.
           Clustering means that, instead of us giving labels for the algorithm to predict, we just give the dataset and let the algorithm find structures in our data. We don't specify labels, or 'supervise' the algorithm
           hence the name is unsupervised learning. One example can be to find customer clusters in an e-commerce's customer dataset. Anomaly detection is used to detect unusual data, particularly useful in finance industry for fraud detection.
           Dimensionality reduction is about reducing the dimensions of the data and losing as little information as possible. Also learned about linear regression. Linear regression is one of the most basic supervised learning algorithm. It is used to predict number outcomes, such as the price of a house.
           There are two types of supervised learning: regression which is to predict infinitely many possible outputs (numbers) and classification which is to predict finite number of possible outputs.

           In linear regression, we try to predict the value by creating a straight line across the dataset in the scatter plot. By the straight line, we can predict new values based on their feature values.
